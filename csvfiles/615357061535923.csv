WATERLOO, IA., BRYANT YARD (SOUTH END LEAD)
HEAVY SNOW AND BLOWING SNOW -NEAR B","LIZZARD CONDITIONS 

AT APPROXIMATELY 12:57 PM, THE EXTRA XIANR4003N, ARRIVED BRYANT YARD WITH FIV","E LOCOMOTIVES AND A 123-CAR TRAIN. THE CREW WAS INSTRUCTED TO BRING THEIR TRAIN DOWN TRACK 2. AS STA","TED ABOVE, THERE WAS HEAVY SNOW AT THE TIME AND VISIBILITY WAS POOR. THE CONDUCTOR HAD DISMOUNTED FR","OM THE TRAIN IN ORDER TO MAKE A CUT ON THE REAR PORTION OF THE TRAIN.  AS THE MOVE PROGRESSED, THE E","NGINEER WAS HAVING TROUBLE IDENTIFYING THE POSITION OF THE SWITCH POINTS / SWITCH TARGETS AND IN ADD","ITION, THERE WAS AN “OFF TRACK” END-LOADER CLEARING SNOW FROM NEXT TO THE TRACKS. ONCE CLOSE ENOUGH","TO SEE THE SWITCHES HE SAW THAT THE ROUTE WAS IN FACT LINED FOR HIS MOVEMENT. 
AT THIS MOMENT, THE","ENGINEER ALSO NOTICED THAT THE HEAD CAR ON THE MAIN TRACK WAS FOULING THE LEAD. HE APPLIED AN EMERGE","NCY BRAKE APPLICATION; HOWEVER, HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP SHORT OF THE FOULING CAR, WHEREIN THE LOCOMOTI","VES SIDESWIPED THE CAR, CAUSING LADDER AND HANDHOLD SAFETY APPLIANCES TO THE CAR AND THREE LOCOMOTIV","ES. 
UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AS TO HOW AND WHY THE CAR WAS LEFT OUT TO FOUL, IT WAS DETERMINED T","HAT THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT MANAGER HAD EARLIER INSTRUCTED A CREW TO LEAVE THE CAR AS IT","WAS POSITIONED, WITH THE INTENT OF HAVING THE ABOVE MENTIONED INBOUND TRAIN CREW STOP AND PLACE THE","CAR INTO THE CLEAR.

AT APPROXIMATELY 0001, A CREW OPERATING A NORTHBOUND LITE ENGINE CONSIST (7 LOC","OMOTIVES) APPROACHED THE SOUTH NEW LEAD SWITCH AT BRYANT YARD WITH THE INTENT OF STOPPING TO LINE TH","E SWITCH IN ORDER TO PROCEED TOWARD TRACK 6. AS THE ENGINEER APPLIED THE INDEPENDENT BRAKES TO THE C","ONSIST, NO BRAKING EFFECT OCCURRED DUE TO SNOW BUILD UP ON THE BRAKE SYSTEM APPARATUS. AS A RESULT O","F NOT BEING ABLE TO STOP, THE ENGINE CONSIST COLLIDED WITH A SECOND SET OF LITE ENGINES (4 LOCOMOTIV","ES) SITTING ON THE MAIN TRACK. THE COLLISION CAUSED THE RAIL TO SPREAD AND SUBSEQUENTLY DERAILED LEA","DING LOCOMOTIVE AND ONE LOCOMOTIVE IN SECOND CONSIST. 

THE BRAKING EFFECT WAS NOT ACHIEVED DUE TO","BRAKE APPARATUS NOT BEING CONDITIONED PRIOR TO THE BRAKE APPLICATION.","","","","","","","","0","42.465371","-92.314843","2","5","","","","WATERLOO",
